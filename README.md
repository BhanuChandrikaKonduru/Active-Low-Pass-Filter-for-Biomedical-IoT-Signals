# Active Low-Pass Filter for Biomedical/IoT Signals
Implemented and simulated a second-order Sallen-Key low-pass filter (fc ≈ 150 Hz) to remove high-frequency noise before ADC sampling. Optimized component ratios for 40 dB/decade roll-off and phase margin > 45°.  
**Tools:** LTspice | MATLAB bode() verification
